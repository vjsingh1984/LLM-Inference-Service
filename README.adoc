== Overview

The LLM Inference Service is a cost-effective, production-ready inference server that democratizes access to large language model deployment using consumer-grade hardware. Built to address the economic and technical challenges of modern LLM infrastructure, it provides a unified solution for teams who need enterprise capabilities without datacenter GPU costs.

=== Why This Project Exists

**Economic Reality**: The current LLM infrastructure landscape forces an impossible choice - either pay $30,000+ for datacenter GPUs (H100, A100) or struggle with fragmented, limited tooling. Most teams, researchers, and startups simply cannot justify the cost of datacenter hardware for experimentation and development.

**Technical Gaps**: Existing solutions have critical limitations:

* **Ollama**: Limited enterprise features, poor GPU sharding, no comprehensive monitoring
* **vLLM**: Complex multi-GPU quantization setup, steep learning curve
* **OpenAI API**: Expensive, vendor lock-in, no control over infrastructure
* **No unified dashboard**: No single interface for monitoring, debugging, and managing multiple models

**Infrastructure Challenges**: Teams need to maximize their existing hardware investment through intelligent utilization of motherboard PCIe lanes and consumer GPUs, rather than splurging on single high-VRAM datacenter cards.

=== What This Solution Provides

**🏗️ Cost-Effective Infrastructure**
* Run 70B+ models on multiple consumer GPUs (RTX 4090, RTX 3090) instead of single datacenter GPU
* Intelligent tensor splitting across mixed GPU configurations 
* Support for multi-GPU consumer cards (Tesla M10 equivalent, modern variants) for experimentation
* Maximize PCIe lane utilization on standard motherboards

**🔧 Unified API Compatibility**
* Full compatibility with OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, and HuggingFace TGI APIs
* Dynamic model inspection that bypasses artificial context limitations (e.g., 32K models showing as 4K)
* Think tag preservation for reasoning models
* Real-time streaming with progress tracking

**📊 Enterprise-Grade Monitoring & Debugging**
* Real-time dashboard with live GPU monitoring (4x Tesla M10 GPUs with temperature, utilization, memory tracking)
* Multi-API health monitoring with actual endpoint metrics (not simulated data)
* Interactive model analytics with context length detection and performance insights
* 15-second refresh monitoring to prevent API overload
* Single UI for managing 52+ models, API endpoints, and troubleshooting

**🚀 Production Deployment**
* One-command SystemD service installation with automatic recovery
* Zero-downtime configuration updates
* Load balancing across GPU clusters
* Enterprise logging and alerting

=== How It Works

**Smart GPU Utilization**
The service automatically detects and optimally distributes workloads across available consumer GPUs, regardless of VRAM differences or generations. This enables teams to build powerful inference clusters using affordable consumer hardware instead of expensive datacenter solutions.

**Dynamic Model Intelligence**
By integrating directly with Ollama CLI, the service dynamically discovers true model capabilities - solving the common problem where models artificially report 4K context limits when they actually support 32K+ tokens.

**Unified Architecture**
A clean, modular codebase with format-specific adapters ensures compatibility across multiple AI providers while maintaining a single codebase and deployment model.

**Real-World Impact**: This approach enables startups and research teams to experiment with state-of-the-art models using existing hardware, while providing the monitoring and debugging capabilities needed for production deployment.
